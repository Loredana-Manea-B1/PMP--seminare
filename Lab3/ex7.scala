//Imagine a game where you have a spinner and five dice with different numbers
//of sides. The spinner has five possible outcomes with equal probability: 4, 6, 8,
//12, and 20. In the game, you first spin the spinner. Then you roll a fair die
//whose number of sides is the result of the spinner. Write a Figaro program to
//represent this game.
//a Compute the probability that you rolled a 12-sided die.
//b Compute the probability that you rolled a 7.
//c Compute the probability that you rolled a 12-sided die given that you rolled a 7.
//d Compute the probability that you rolled a 7 given that you rolled a 12-sided die
